Hello, thanks for stepping by, it's great to have you here! :)

I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study/cdt-foundational-ai/current-student-profiles">Foundational AI CDT</a> at University College London, working with <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/ricardosilva">Ricardo Silva</a> and <a href="https://mkusner.github.io/">Matt Kusner</a>. Previously, I obtained a MSc. in Advanced Computing at Imperial College London and interned at Reka AI.

If you are interested in my work or would like to chat about common interests, potential collaboration, etc., please feel free to get in touch!
